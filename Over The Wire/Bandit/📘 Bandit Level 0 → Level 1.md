1. **SSH into the target machine using the given credentials:**

2. **Once logged in, list files in the current directory:**
    
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
    
    - You‚Äôll see a file named `readme`.
        
3. **Read the contents of `readme` using `cat`:**
    
    ```bash
    cat readme
    ```
