**Challenge URL:** [Bandit Level 5](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit5.html)

---

#### üîê Level Goal:

> The password for the next level is stored in a **file somewhere under the `inhere` directory** and has the following properties:
> 
> - It is **human-readable**
>     
> - It is **1033 bytes in size**
>     
> - It is **not executable**
>     

---

#### üß† Concept:

This level tests:

- Using `find` with multiple conditions (`-type`, `-size`, `-executable`)
    
- Filtering by file size
    
- Displaying specific file content
