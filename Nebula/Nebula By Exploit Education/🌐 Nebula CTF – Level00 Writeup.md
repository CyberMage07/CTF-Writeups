### 🔐 Challenge Overview

The objective for this level is to locate a **SetUID binary** owned by the `flag00` user and exploit its elevated privileges to obtain the flag.

> 🧭 _Hint:_ You can either manually traverse the filesystem looking for suspicious files or use the `find` command with appropriate flags.

---

### 🛠️ Approach

Once logged in as `level00`, our focus is to enumerate binaries with the **SetUID bit** set and **owned by `flag00`**.

We’ll use:

```bash
find / -user flag00 -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null
```

**Explanation:**

- `/` — Start from the root directory.
    
- `-user flag00` — Filter files owned by user `flag00`.
    
- `-perm -4000` — Look for files with the SetUID permission bit.
    
- `-type f` — Ensure it’s a regular file.
    
- `2>/dev/null` — Silence permission-denied errors.

### 🧪 Discovery & Execution

From the output, we find:

```bash
/home/flag00/flag00
```

Let’s execute it:

```bash
/home/flag00/flag00
```

It returns:

```
Congratulations, now run getflag to get your flag
```

Execute:

```bash
getflag
```

✅ Output:

```
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```

Mission accomplished.

### 📘 What We Learned

This level demonstrated how SetUID binaries, when owned by privileged users, can be leveraged for **privilege escalation**. The `find` command becomes a powerful ally in enumerating such binaries.

> While straightforward, it sets the tone for real-world enumeration techniques and reinforces the importance of file permission hygiene on UNIX systems.
