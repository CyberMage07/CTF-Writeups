### 🧾 Challenge Description

> A `.pcap` file (packet capture) is world-readable in `flag08`'s home directory.  
> Your task is to analyze this file, find exposed credentials, and use them to access `flag08`.

**Login:** `level08 : level08`  
**Target File:** `/home/flag08/capture.pcap`

---

### 🧰 Tools Required

- `scp` or `rsync` (to copy the file locally)
    
- `wireshark` or `tshark` (for packet analysis)
    

---

### 🧪 Analysis Steps

#### 📥 Step 1: Transfer the PCAP file

```bash
scp level08@<target-ip>:/home/flag08/capture.pcap .
```

Authenticate with the password `level08` to retrieve the file locally.

---

#### 🧵 Step 2: Open in Wireshark

```bash
wireshark capture.pcap
```

Use **“Follow TCP Stream”** on packets that contain suspicious data. Look out for keywords like:

- `login`
    
- `password`
    
- `Incorrect Password`
    

✅ One stream shows:

```
Incorrect Password
```

Switch to **Hex + ASCII view**. Among the gibberish, you'll spot:

```
62 61 63 6b 64 30 30 52 6d 61 74 65  →  backd00Rmate
```

This is the **exposed password** in plain text.

---

### 🔐 Step 3: Log in with the Recovered Credentials

```bash
ssh flag08@<target-ip>
Password: backd00Rmate
```

You're now inside as `flag08`.

---

### 🏁 Step 4: Retrieve the Flag

```bash
getflag
```

✅ Output:

```
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```

### 🧠 Lessons Learned

This level is a classic demonstration of **why packet captures are sensitive** and must never be exposed to unauthorized users.

🔓 **Security Tip:**

> Avoid transmitting credentials in plaintext protocols. Always secure traffic using encryption (e.g., TLS), and restrict access to packet logs and monitoring files.
