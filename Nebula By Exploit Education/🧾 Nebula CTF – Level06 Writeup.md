### 🕵️ Challenge Brief

> The credentials for `flag06` originate from a **legacy Unix system** — hinting that a traditional, weakly hashed password may be recoverable.
> 
> Your goal is to identify the password and use it to escalate access.

**Login:** `level06 : [password to crack]`

### 🔍 Step 1: Find the Flag User’s Entry

We begin by inspecting `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/shadow` to extract the password hash (depending on where it resides on this system):

```bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep flag06
```

On some systems, the hashed password might be exposed directly in `/etc/passwd` if it uses legacy password storage (e.g., DES-based systems).

If the hash is present there, copy it into a file named `hash.txt`.

Example entry:

```
flag06:ueqwOCnSGdsuM:504:504::/home/flag06:/bin/bash
```

Extract just the hash line:

```bash
echo 'flag06:ueqwOCnSGdsuM:504:504::/home/flag06:/bin/bash' > hash.txt
```

### 🧨 Step 2: Crack the Password

Use **John the Ripper** with a common wordlist:

```bash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt
```

Let John do its magic…

✅ Eventually, it reveals:

```
hello
```

---

### 🔐 Step 3: Switch User

Use the cracked password:

```bash
su flag06
Password: hello
```

---

### 🏁 Step 4: Get the Flag

```bash
getflag
```

✅ Output:

```
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```

### 📘 Takeaway

This level reminds us that **legacy password schemes and weak hashing** still haunt real-world systems today. Unsalted hashes and dictionary words make it trivial for attackers to crack credentials.

💡 **Security Tip:**

> Always use modern hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2), enforce strong password policies, and store hashes in secure shadow files.
