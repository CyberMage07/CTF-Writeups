**Challenge URL:** [Bandit Level 13](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit13.html)

---

#### üîê Level Goal:

> The password for the next level is **stored in `etc/bandit_pass/bandit14`**, but you **do not have permission** to read it directly.  
> However, there is a **setuid binary called `./sshkey.private`** that will help you log in as **bandit14** using SSH.

---

#### üß† Concept:

This level introduces:

- **SSH key-based login**
    
- Understanding and using **private SSH keys**
    
- Running a **setuid binary** to escalate privileges securely

    sshkey.private
    ```
    
3. **Set correct permissions:**
    
    ```bash
    chmod 600 sshkey.private
    ```

    ```bash
    ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
    ```
